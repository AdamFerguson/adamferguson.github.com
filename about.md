# Hi! 

Thanks for checking out my site. I'm a software developer living in beautiful Charlotte, NC.

![Beautiful, wouldn't you agree?](/assets/images/marshall-park-charlotte-nc.jpg)

I prefer working in Unix-like environments and am culturally aligned, as a developer, with the open source community. I am constantly trying to expand my horizons and learn more, as far as software development goes. I currently enjoy working with Ruby, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java/Android. I enjoy coming up with simple, flexible, and clean solutions to programming problems.

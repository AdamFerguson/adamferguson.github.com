# Hi! 

Thanks for checking out my site. I'm a software developer living in beautiful Charlotte, NC.

![Beautiful, wouldn't you agree?](/assets/images/marshall-park-charlotte-nc.jpg)

I started getting serious about software relatively late. My favorite classes in high school
were computer science (hands down) and I went to college with the intent of pursuing software as
a career. In college I discovered a love for economics (and other more philosophical subjects), and ended up taking a bit of a tangent to attend graduate school for economics. However, after ultimately deciding that econ grad school and the life of a professional academic economist wasn't the right path for me (at that point in my life) and that I needed to experience the 'real' world. 

Ever since then I have been moving increasingly more towards the technical side of software development and the deeper I get, the more I love it. There's something very satisfying about solving a software problem in a clean, simple, flexible way. In the occasional cases where it happens, I still feel a rush. 

I was schooled in the typical c++, java, vb/vb.net, c# group of languages. However, professionally I've found myself moving more towards open source solutions (and away from Microsoft). This is partially b/c I'm cheap and don't like paying hundreds of dollars for development tools that I can get for little to nothing in the open source realm (and there seem to be more resources out there for learning open source tools, besides). It's also partially b/c I worked (and did most of my actual learning about real world programming) in a perl shop with a group of awesome developers that were very committed to open source. 

In some ways, perl feels like my first language and it heavily influenced everything I've learned since. Despite that, when I first started working in perl I felt like it might have been hurting me. Doing serious development in a text editor felt pretty amateur having experienced IDE's like Visual Studio and Eclipse. But, knowing what I know now, I think it was one of the best things to happen to me professionally. Not having tools to generate code or point out typing errors exposed me to all lots of the little details of the interworking of the program in the course of execution. It also forced me to mentally be more disciplined and detail oriented when programming. Working with perl exposed me to the advantages that come from working with dynamic languages. It was also some of my first exposure to functional programming which seems to be increasingly more and more relevant in my recent work with Ruby and Javascript. Finally, you can't spend any serious time working with perl without spending some time messing around with Linux which, I hate to admit, prior to perl I hadn't spent much time doing. I

Recently, I'm happy to say that I get to work with Ruby professionally. Ruby feels like Perl with the knob turned up to 11. For the longest time, while working in perl, I spent my free time studying Java and its libraries and frameworks. I craved the abstractions that were offered in Java (doing OO in perl is neither straightforward nor, in my experience, very common). Ruby, though, feels like it took all the best parts of perl and java and just crammed them together (with a significantly cleaner syntax than either to boot!). The community around Ruby right now is also awesome. In my day to day I also work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java. Javascript, in particular is something I've been very excited about recently. There's a lot of cool stuff happening in javascript right now. It looks like like simple, sophisticated, cross browser, client side applications may be common in the not to distant future (not to mention Node.js and asynchronous javascript on the server).

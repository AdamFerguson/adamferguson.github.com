<span class="s1">        Please do the following:</span>
<span class="s1">        1. Copy config/application.yml.example to config/application.yml.</span>

<span class="s1">        work without modification. However, it&#39;</span>s always good to know what<span class="err">&#39;</span>s available to change later.
        3. Restart Diaspora!

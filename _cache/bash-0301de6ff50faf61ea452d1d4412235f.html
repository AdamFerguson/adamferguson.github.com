      ******** You havent <span class="nb">set </span>up your Diaspora settings file. **********
      Please <span class="k">do </span>the following:
      1. Copy config/application.yml.example to config/application.yml.
      2. Have a look at the settings in that file. It has sensible defaults <span class="k">for </span>development, which <span class="o">(</span>we hope<span class="o">)</span>
      work without modification. However, it<span class="s1">&#39;s always good to know what&#39;</span>s available to change later.
      3. Restart Diaspora!
